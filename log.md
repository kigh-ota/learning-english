3分程度の音声を選ぶ（TED-Ed, 6 Minute Englishなど）
10〜15秒ずつ再生 → 聞こえた通りに書く（完璧じゃなくてOK）
スクリプトで答え合わせ
聞き取れなかった単語を「なぜ聞こえなかったか」メモ
  音のつながり（例：gonna, wanna）
  弱音化（例：of → /əv/）
  速さ・アクセントなど

成果物：「聞き取れなかった理由」と「語彙・音の気づき」

- 聞き取れなかった語・表現のリスト
- 新出語彙

## シャドーイングのやり方

- 🎯 ステップ1：スクリプト見ながら一文ずつシャドーイング（最初の数回）
  - 目的：音と文字の対応をつかむ
  - ✅ 使い方：英文を目で追いながら、音声の直後に発話
  - 💡 コツ：冠詞や助動詞など「聞こえにくい語」に線を引きながらやると◎
- 🎯 ステップ2：スクリプトを“見ないで”通しシャドーイング
  - 目的：純粋なリスニング力・反応速度を鍛える
  - ✅ 使い方：音だけを頼りに追いかける（＝本番に近い）
  - 💡 うまく言えなかった部分は後でスクリプトを見て確認 → 弱点発見の瞬間
- 🎯 ステップ3：再びスクリプトを見て音読・復習＋気づきチェック
  - 目的：正確な構文・語順・発音を整理する
  - ✅ 「最終確認」として1回しっかり読んで締め

各ステップ5分ずつとか。

成果物：「発音・音のリズムの再現性」と「音に慣れた英文（＝自分の武器文）」

your brain gets warm also when generally it gets warm
so that's why you ? yawn if it's a summer day or if you are in a hot and stuffy room

### 所感

- 英文を頭に記憶するキャパシティがとても低い、書き取る前にすぐ頭から消えてしまう
  - 適当に想像して補完している
  - 日本語だとどれくらい記憶して書き取れるか？は気にしたい。日本語でできない分量は英語でも無理なはず
- 簡単そうな英語だが、リスニングだと意味が半分くらいしか取れてない
- 冠詞、代名詞など汎用的な語の聞き取り精度が低い
  - 素早く発音されるからか
- 単語はほぼ全てわかる、スクリプトを読めば読解はできる
