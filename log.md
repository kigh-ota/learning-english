I'm Neil 
Hello there, today we've got 6 minutes to talk about honesty, and how honest people are,

Well it's pay for something putting in the box???, but it's up to you to put into it right amount.
A small business might use this method to take things like parking a car or buying a newspaper because you don't need a sales assistant
but that means people could read a newspaper or park a car without paying anything.
honesty box relies on people being honest
the adjective honest means truthful, and not trying to cheat people
and now, honesty means being truthful.
have you ever cheated an honesty box Rob?

### 所感

- 英文を頭に記憶するキャパシティがとても低い、書き取る前にすぐ頭から消えてしまう
  - 適当に想像して補完している
  - 日本語だとどれくらい記憶して書き取れるか？は気にしたい。日本語でできない分量は英語でも無理なはず
- 簡単そうな英語だが、リスニングだと意味が半分くらいしか取れてない
- 冠詞、代名詞など汎用的な語の聞き取り精度が低い
  - 素早く発音されるからか
- 単語はほぼ全てわかる、スクリプトを読めば読解はできる
